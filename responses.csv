870_A_1,"To determine the pattern in the given sequence, we analyze the progression of shapes and the number of dots within each shape. The sequence starts with a single dot, and each subsequent pattern adds one more row and one more column to the previous shape, while always omitting the top left dot. This creates a grid of dots with each shape being one unit larger than the previous one in both dimensions. The correct answer describes this pattern accurately, while the wrong answer describes a sequence of square patterns with green dots, which does not match the given sequence of shapes with missing top left dots.",Square patterns with increasing size,"The wrong answer assumes that the sequence is made up of square patterns that increase in size. However, the given sequence is not composed of squares but rather rectangles that increase in both width and height, with the top left dot consistently missing."
870_A_2,"To determine the pattern in the given sequence, we analyze the progression of shapes and the number of dots within each shape. The sequence starts with a single dot, and each subsequent pattern adds one more row and one more column to the previous shape, while always omitting the top left dot. This creates a grid of dots with each shape being one unit larger than the previous one in both dimensions. The correct answer describes this pattern accurately, while the wrong answer describes a sequence of square patterns with green dots, which does not match the given sequence of shapes with missing top left dots.",Color of dots,"The wrong answer introduces a color change (from red to green) that is not present in the original sequence. The original sequence does not specify a color, and the pattern is based on the arrangement and size of the dots, not their color."
870_A_3,"To determine the pattern in the given sequence, we analyze the progression of shapes and the number of dots within each shape. The sequence starts with a single dot, and each subsequent pattern adds one more row and one more column to the previous shape, while always omitting the top left dot. This creates a grid of dots with each shape being one unit larger than the previous one in both dimensions. The correct answer describes this pattern accurately, while the wrong answer describes a sequence of square patterns with green dots, which does not match the given sequence of shapes with missing top left dots.",Top left dot present,"The wrong answer describes square patterns with all dots present, including the top left dot. In contrast, the correct answer specifies that the top left dot is always missing in each pattern, which is a crucial aspect of the sequence's pattern."
870_A_4,"To determine the pattern in the given sequence, we analyze the progression of shapes and the number of dots within each shape. The sequence starts with a single dot, and each subsequent pattern adds one more row and one more column to the previous shape, while always omitting the top left dot. This creates a grid of dots with each shape being one unit larger than the previous one in both dimensions. The correct answer describes this pattern accurately, while the wrong answer describes a sequence of square patterns with green dots, which does not match the given sequence of shapes with missing top left dots.",Linear progression,"The wrong answer suggests a linear progression in terms of the number of dots, which is not the case. The correct sequence involves a two-dimensional progression where both the width and the height of the rectangles increase by one with each step, not a simple linear increase in the number of dots."
870_B_1,"The given sequence is a series of odd numbers starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, 7,...). To find the next number in the sequence, we identify the pattern and apply it. The pattern here is that each number is 2 more than the previous number (1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 2 = 7,...). Therefore, to find the next number, we add 2 to the last number in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9). The correct answer is 9, which is an odd number following the established pattern of adding 2 to the previous number in the sequence.",Cubes instead of dots,"The wrong answer incorrectly interprets the sequence as a series of cubes rather than a series of numbers. The sequence is not three-dimensional, and the concept of cubes does not apply to a one-dimensional sequence of numbers."
870_B_2,"The given sequence is a series of odd numbers starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, 7,...). To find the next number in the sequence, we identify the pattern and apply it. The pattern here is that each number is 2 more than the previous number (1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 2 = 7,...). Therefore, to find the next number, we add 2 to the last number in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9). The correct answer is 9, which is an odd number following the established pattern of adding 2 to the previous number in the sequence.",Incorrect pattern recognition,"The wrong answer fails to recognize the pattern of consecutive odd numbers. Instead, it incorrectly assumes a pattern of increasing cube sizes, which does not align with the given sequence of numbers."
870_B_3,"The given sequence is a series of odd numbers starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, 7,...). To find the next number in the sequence, we identify the pattern and apply it. The pattern here is that each number is 2 more than the previous number (1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 2 = 7,...). Therefore, to find the next number, we add 2 to the last number in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9). The correct answer is 9, which is an odd number following the established pattern of adding 2 to the previous number in the sequence.",Adding dimensions,"The wrong answer introduces a three-dimensional concept (cubes) to a one-dimensional sequence, which is a misconception. The sequence is linear and should be analyzed as such, without adding unnecessary dimensions."
870_B_4,"The given sequence is a series of odd numbers starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, 7,...). To find the next number in the sequence, we identify the pattern and apply it. The pattern here is that each number is 2 more than the previous number (1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 2 = 7,...). Therefore, to find the next number, we add 2 to the last number in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9). The correct answer is 9, which is an odd number following the established pattern of adding 2 to the previous number in the sequence.",Size of cubes,"The wrong answer incorrectly assigns sizes to the cubes (2, 3, 4) as if they were dimensions of the sequence. However, the sequence consists of single numbers, not volumes or areas, and thus does not have dimensions."
870_C_1,"The correct solution involves identifying the pattern in the sequence of numbers provided (1, 3, 5, 7,...) and determining the rule that generates the next term. In this case, the pattern is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. To find the next term, we add 2 to the last term in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9). The correct answer describes a visual pattern of red dots with one dot missing from the top left corner in each subsequent pattern, which corresponds to the sequence of numbers when each dot represents a unit (1, 4, 9, 16,...). The visual pattern is a representation of square numbers, where each square has one dot missing from the top left corner.",Incorrect color choice,"The wrong answer incorrectly uses blue dots instead of red dots, which does not match the original sequence of numbers (1, 3, 5, 7,...) that are associated with red dots in the correct answer."
870_C_2,"The correct solution involves identifying the pattern in the sequence of numbers provided (1, 3, 5, 7,...) and determining the rule that generates the next term. In this case, the pattern is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. To find the next term, we add 2 to the last term in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9). The correct answer describes a visual pattern of red dots with one dot missing from the top left corner in each subsequent pattern, which corresponds to the sequence of numbers when each dot represents a unit (1, 4, 9, 16,...). The visual pattern is a representation of square numbers, where each square has one dot missing from the top left corner.",Incorrect geometric shape,"The wrong answer describes triangles instead of squares. The correct pattern is based on square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16,...), where each term represents the area of a square with one dot missing from the top left corner. Triangles do not correspond to the sequence of square numbers."
870_C_3,"The correct solution involves identifying the pattern in the sequence of numbers provided (1, 3, 5, 7,...) and determining the rule that generates the next term. In this case, the pattern is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. To find the next term, we add 2 to the last term in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9).

The visual pattern is a representation of square numbers, where each square has one dot missing from the top left corner.",Incorrect pattern progression,"The wrong answer suggests that each subsequent pattern adds a fixed number of dots to form a new row, which does not align with the square number sequence. The correct pattern involves squares with one dot missing, which grows in size by increasing the side length by one for each term in the sequence."
870_C_4,"The correct solution involves identifying the pattern in the sequence of numbers provided (1, 3, 5, 7,...) and determining the rule that generates the next term. In this case, the pattern is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. To find the next term, we add 2 to the last term in the sequence (7 + 2 = 9).

The visual pattern is a representation of square numbers, where each square has one dot missing from the top left corner.",Lack of connection to the sequence,"The wrong answer fails to connect the visual pattern of dots to the numerical sequence provided. The correct answer shows that the number of dots in each pattern corresponds to the square numbers, which is a fundamental aspect of the sequence."
1109_A_1,"To determine the pattern in the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10,..., we observe the differences between consecutive terms: 3-1=2, 6-3=3, 10-6=4. This suggests that the sequence is formed by adding consecutive natural numbers to the previous term. The nth term of this sequence can be found using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n+1)/2. Therefore, the nth term is given by n(n+1)/2. This pattern is known as triangle numbers, as they can be represented by dark blue circles arranged into triangles. The incorrect answer suggests a pattern of square numbers, which would involve adding consecutive squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2,...) to the previous term, which does not match the given sequence.",Assuming the sequence is based on square numbers,"The given sequence does not represent the sum of consecutive squares. Square numbers follow the pattern 1, 4, 9, 16,..., where each term is the square of its position in the sequence (n^2). The differences between consecutive square numbers are not constant, unlike the differences in the given sequence, which are consecutive natural numbers."
