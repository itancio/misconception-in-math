## Setting up Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, Python supplies a built in venv module which provides the basic functionality needed for the virtual environment. Running the command below will create a virtual environment named "openai-env" inside the current folder you have selected in your terminal / command line:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Then activate using this cmd:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
